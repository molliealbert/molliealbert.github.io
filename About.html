        <h1>More about me...</h1>
        <p>
            <br />I'm currently a senior at The University of Oklahoma (OU) pursuing degrees in both Marketing and Management Information Systems (MIS). I'll be graduating in May, 2022 and I hope to pursue a career that combines
            my interests in Marketing, Analytics, and Social Media. Moving from my hometown in Pennsylvania to attend college in Oklahoma has opened my mind to job opportunities across the country.<br /><br />

            During my time at OU, I've had the opportunity to explore a number of my interests through various internships and work experiences. These experiences include being a Marketing Intern for OU Athletics, an Amazon Prime Student Campus Manager for Riddle & Bloom, and a Marketing Intern
            for Minitab. The pictures to the right showcase me working in these positions.
